Hi,I was sick of **VisualStudio20XX** and sick of having **no intellisense**.<br/>
So I dedcided to make **my own extension** to fix all the issues I face while developing Unreal Tools/Project by making my own extesion.<br/>
**PS: I'm starting small by creating usefull shortcut but at the end I'll definitively create an intellisense (even if it's static nad just helping with the most commun types)**
